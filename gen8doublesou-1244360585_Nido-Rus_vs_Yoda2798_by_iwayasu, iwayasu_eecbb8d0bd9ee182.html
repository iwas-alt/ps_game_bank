0#Crown Tundra Doubles OU Kickoff Tournament, Yoda2798 vs Nido-Rus, Game 1.
0*#Nidorus: super standard pivot + fo lead. Yoda: incineroar is mandatory, like the fini lead, she (yeah fini is a girl in my head) has good offensive pressure and isnt instantly scared out by anything. 
1#Calcing fo, incineroar is close to max hp + def. Lando not hp berry, I wonder what set it is. Straightforward turn by both players, but @I WONDER IF INCINEROAR COULD HAVE HARD SWITCHED TO KART (WOULD THAT EVEN BE GOOD)?
2#I like the celesteela switch, it can&#x27;t be threatened by lando or blastoise. I also like fini staying in. The double turn from nidorus was super free and obvious, so might as well stay in with 2 fat mons than takes rocks with a squishy and be forced out again anyways. For nidorus kyub + koko is pretty obvious, kinda the only two mons that hit fini and celesteela.
3#@IS THE CELESTEELA PROTECT CORRECT? Feels abit too obvious. I get it &quot;beats&quot; bolt strike fini + volt steela (or smth else I&#x27;m not thinking of), but 1. at this point in the game fini seems more of a threat than steela, 2. it carries protect waaay less often so the double into fini was kinda likely. Steela is still useless on the board next turn, maybe switching to incineroar was better there? 
4#@I MAINTAIN THAT STEELA IS NOT A THREAT, I don&#x27;t like nidorus&#x27; play. Now kartana has arguably 2 free turns (uncontested fo plus sub). No tailwind on kart tho so banded zygarde isnt a monster (yet).
5#Uneventful turn, @NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE KNOCK, since calcing it does not put kyub in KO range for sacred sword (even against 0 def kyub). I could see a blastoise or lando switch, but would flare blitz have been the better play?
6#From calcing icy wind kyurem was 252 spa vs 252 spdef / 0 spa vs ~100 spdef. I really did not like icy wind from nidorus, because 1. white herb is kinda common, 2. ice beam definitely kills, and nothing switches into ice beam + the threat of it is too strong for zygarde to come in to either slot realistically. @MAYBE I’M WRONG HERE? 
7#I like yoda bring zygarde out here but its so scary. Maybe he speed crept it. Electroweb has slightly lesser than 50% chance to ko kartana. While offensively kyub is very good in this endgame, I think it was okay to sac given its health and speed tier. Same can be said about lando tho so I don&#x27;t hate the play. I guess it was a 0 speed kyub so he knew he was slower. 
8#straightforward turn. FO on mew so no tailwind, koko still good for speed.
9#@ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR THE FOLLOW ME? There was no reason to not attack kart with blastoise (flip turn always kills 7% hp btw). Especially since ddarts naturally &quot;counters&quot; protect and calcing will tell you ddarts doesn&#x27;t always kill kart.
10#The rest of the game is one massive trainwreck lmao. What a freeze. Also, ice beam + fire blast, what a mew set. I stand by flipturn as the better play turn 9, crazy how a tiny endgame mistake loses to hax.

I guess it was a 0 speed kyub so he knew he was slower.
