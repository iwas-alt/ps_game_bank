0# Immediately I don&#x27;t like this matchup. I&#x27;m running fullroom and Zikam has brought two priority attackers (Azumarill and Scizor), and two damage sponges (Chansey and Blastoise) and Blastoise has FO, to help stall TR turns. Right away I know I have to prevent Azu from getting off a belly drum, and I predict oppo will try to lead it to get the BD off while I&#x27;m trying to get off TR. I chose to lead Victini + P2, assuming opponent would lead Blastoise + Azu. My plan was to Final Gambit and thunderbolt the azu slot, assuming my opponent would either FO one of my mons and belly drum, or follow me with Toise + belly drum. If FO, I would ko azu, and if follow me then I&#x27;d ko the blastoise with final gambit, and KO azu with thunderbolt after he halves HP with Belly Drum. If opponent leads something else, I can always just FG + TR.
0*# Opponent leads scizor + Azu. So I know that Victini is exerting a ton of pressure on the Scizor, so opponent will have to switch it out. I want to save Victini for later to take out the scizor, as my team is a little steel weak. So I can just trick choice scarf onto Azu, locking it into either an attack or BD, and preventing it from getting a +6 boost and then firing of aqua jets. Then I can just TR with my P2.
1*# Turn 1 went perfectly. If it hadn&#x27;t gone this well, I don&#x27;t think I win this match.
2# Since Azu is locked in to BD, and Blastoise isn&#x27;t an offensive threat, I can free switch into two TR attackers. I choose Lurantis + Gigalith since Gigalith is my best spread attacker, and Lurantis can start firing off superpowers to get att and defense boosts.
3# Now I&#x27;m in a great position. I can simply Rock slide + Superpower the Chansey. I can get big damage on opponent&#x27;s damage sponges.
3*# Opponent makes the right play, sacrificing the crippled Azumarill. I think a flip turn here from Blastoise would make more sense than Toxic, as opponent could then flip turn into a priority attacker like Scizor, and then bring in Blastoise in the Ko&#x27;d Azumarill slot and Fake out.
4# I know Gigalith can take a bullet punch, so I decide to Rock slide + Superpower the Scizor.
4*# Opponent makes the correct play here, as Blastoise would survive a rock slide and then be koed by the Superpower. Opponent wisely chooses to take out the Lurantis. I should have seen this play coming and switched into P2 here, saving my Lurantis as it&#x27;s great against Chansey.
5# I bring in P2 here, as it can take out either the Landorus or the Naganadel with Ice beam or the scizor with thunderbolt, and since there&#x27;s one turn of TR left it can then be able to set up another TR. I feel extremely confident about this position. 
5*# Aaaanndd my opponent makes a fantastic play that I don&#x27;t see coming. Ban Ally Switch. 
6# Now my opponent is in a really strong position, able to take out my P2 with a second earth power + Seismic toss. I also worry that my opponent may ally switch again, and instead take out my Gigalith. I try to hedge my options by trick rooming on P2, and bringing in Sylveon. If opponent takes out P2, then Sylveon is in at full health and I can bring in either Oranguru and set up another TR, or Victini and FG the Landorus. (This line of thinking is a mistake!!!) If opponent takes out Gigalith, then I&#x27;ve got another TR up.
6*# Opponent wisely takes out P2, not allowing me to get up another TR.
7# I bring in Victini, thinking I can get off a FG on Landorus. I FORGOT I TRICKED MY CHOICE SCARF MEANING LANDORUS IS FASTER. Now my opponent can Earth Power Victini, and I have nothing that can switch in on this. (oranguru can take 1, but it would be ko&#x27;ed the following turn.) I start thinking this is exactly why I don&#x27;t run full room, it sucks after the first TR. (I should be spending this mental energy coming up with a plan, but this is exactly what happens when you&#x27;re in a bad position, you start to panic.) I eventually decide that my only play is to V Create the Chansey and hyper Voice. I recognize that my opponent will earth power Victini to KO, and then I will bring in Oranguru for Victini and I should be able to take an earth power + seismic toss, and get up TR.
7*# Instead my opponent chooses to sludge bomb the Sylveon. I think my opponent&#x27;s best play was to earth power Victini, and then softboil so that Chansey would be full health and able to stall out more turns in the future. But since sludge bomb does not KO, I&#x27;m able to V-create the chansey, getting the KO, and then hyper voice at a single target, meaning it&#x27;s strong enough to KO Landorus.
8# I decide to save Victini, expecting a draco meteor on my Victini and bullet punch on Sylveon, and I need Victini to take out the Scizor. Once Naganadel is at 0.5x SPA, it isn&#x27;t much of a threat anymore. So I choose to switch in Gigalith, who I know can take a Draco Meteor, and sacrifice my Sylveon, by clicking hyper voice.
9# From here I can just V-create the Scizor and rock slide the Naganadel to death.
