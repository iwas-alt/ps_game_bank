0#Round 1 game 1 of DOU Invitationals 2020. Note that dumbry = zstrats; zstrass = umbry ._. 
0*#umbry&#x27;s heatran has godlike mu&#x27;s against zstrats&#x27; team. Her leads aim to put out immediate pressure and leverage the option of a favourable trade to aggressively double switch. zstrats&#x27; boom lead garuantees him to have the faster FO this turn then a good mu against toise forever. From the blacephalon lead I would assume it is sash or scarf. Sash makes more sense for a lead IMO. The possibilty of FO + sash/scarf will definitely put strong offensive pressure on any of umbry&#x27;s leads.
1#Shadowball always kills kart and hits the everything in the back harder and doesn&#x27;t give flash fire. @WHY DID UMBRY HEATWAVE? Heatran is a huge threat to zstrats&#x27; team and he has 0 switch ins to eruption. FO shadowball into tran was also on the table, so eruption was unlikely to hit at full power. @UMBRY SHOULD HAVE SWITCH TRAN OUT OR HEATWAVED. From calcing, zstrats is running a super whack offensive rillaboom. Heatran is likely charcoal but might also be specs. Lando doesn&#x27;t live 2 shadow balls, so switching it in here offers a potential trade of lando/heatran for blace next turn. 
2#There was the line where the trade 1 for 1 if both heatran and lando used ep (I think its a charchoal tran). This line greatly favours zstrats whether he swtiches or shadowballs so umbry does not go for it. Blace could be scarf anyways. Umbry makes a smart play here that covers all options. Against non-choice blace, she offers lando to be greatly in position next turn. Against scarf or blace switching out, she gets guaranteed value with rocks and will be decently in position next turn since toise walls blace and will have FO up. Blace switching out signals that its probably scarf and not sash. 
3#There are many few interesting lines here. If toise follow me&#x27;s and kyub and nihilego both atack, zstrats trades nihilego for toise (not worth). If zstrats switches nihilego while kyub fusion bolt into toise, kyub can get faked out and lando can might get a free uturn. This turn is quite complex and there are many more lines. Umbry makes the more aggressive play and wins this exchange. Umbry&#x27;s lando and zstrats&#x27; nihilego were the two mons threatened this turn. Umbry risked her lando and was rewarded with momentum.
4#Zstrats makes read that umbry will attack nihilego, electing not to protect kart. @I DON&#x27;T AGREE WITH THIS READ, AS THE RISK REWARD IS SKEWED TOWARDS ATTACKING KART. Firstly, shadowball will do damage to everything, whereas mud shot risk being a dead turn if zstrats switches. Secondly, tailwind is a lot more threatening than whatever nihilego can do. I get that zstrats felt the need to make a play while behind, but umbry keeps her cool and plays the straightforward line and punishes zstrats. Boom coming in makes the most sense. 
5#zstrats needs to get his scarf blace into position to force out spectier after forcing out/killing toise before tailwind goes up. Pretty tall task. Saccing nihilego would be one way, but that would put him down too much material anyways. Zstrats makes a game losing play by uturning on the protecting spectier. (he acknoledges this in chat). If he hard switched to blace he would be back in the game. Maybe he expected to sac nihilego and then cycle his FO back to support blace. This guessing game is rigged against zstrats (pretty obviously since he&#x27;s positionally behind). He didn&#x27;t make the hard call and loses on the spot.
6#Now with no fakeout and no blace on the field, zstrats meets his end. Umbry takes a guaranteed winning line and gives up kart. 
7#Clean, straightforward endgame play to close out the game. Ghosthorse&#x27;s FO immunity is the biggest reason its so threatening. Zstrats should have just matched it instead of bringing the stupid scarf blacephalon ._. 
8#P.S. I realise that scarf blace is more likely than sash, but 1. blace unexplored (aka bad) and also the lead to me means that sash is a non-trivial possibility. Scarf is confirmed when zstrats switches blace out." data-p1="dumbry" data-p2="Z Strass" data-gameformat="gen8doublesou" data-credit="iwayasu" data-gameid="gen8doublesou-1246794622">
