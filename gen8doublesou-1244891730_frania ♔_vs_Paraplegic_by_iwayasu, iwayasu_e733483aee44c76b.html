0#DOU invitationals, round 1, frania vs. Paraplegic, game 1.
0*#To me mew + gene would be the most generic lead both players can go for. Frania&#x27;s incineroar would have put pressure on a gene lead, but paraplegic makes a nice play and leads lando instead. 
1#FO on lando + switch incin was the most obvious play for frania, she makes a nice read and manages to trade hazards with a disadvantageous board. Its not really a read becos I think frania would be down to trade some health on incin for spikes. If she committed to a hard read on rocks, she would have hard switched incin out while spiking. However, this will fall behind against lando uturn. Paraplegic&#x27;s FO on incin prevents it from pivoting out/knocking mew, which is likely more advantageous than mew getting a spike. 
2#The mews trade hazards. The spike was likely more valuable, especially given paraplegic&#x27;s quadruple pivot team. Paraplegic&#x27;s team mostly mirror frania&#x27;s, with urshifu + zygarde vs lando + suicune being the only difference. Paraplegic&#x27;s team is undeniably slower in tempo. He needs to play more aggressively to find positioning to setup. Therefore, I&#x27;m not really a fan of the toxic. Lando uturning here would have gotten chip and gained some momentum. However, I understand there are not that many good switch targets. Boom mirror doesnt give anything, incin is slow and will be uturned on. Gene can put on some offensive pressure, but if it came in on tailwind vs tspike (very possible), it has to switch out again to scout the potential mew fireblast. IMO zygarde is just staight up more threatening than suicune and paraplegic lost in builder by bringing a UU mon. He has no threats (worth the risk) to capitalise on the free uturn with and had to go for a low value toxic. 
3#Double spike mew is actually so troll... IDT its no attack mew so paraplegic now won&#x27;t be about to match tailwind. Not that tailwind is super important in this mid-speedy MU, but it could still matter in gene flamethrower mirrors, help low speed investment banded zygarde etc. Nice uturn from frania, recognising that paraplegic doesn&#x27;t threaten anything so FO is pointless. 
4#frania reveals earth power, calcing incin is a p standard 252 hp ~100 spdef set. Both players don&#x27;t want to switch because hazards, especially frania because the earlier she switches the earlier the poison damages starts ticking. In a long game that might even end up justifying double spike mew (god forbid!).
5#paraplegic is put in a must switch (sooner or later) position, because paraplegic&#x27;s mew is the only useless mon in the mirror. No point taking spikes so he goes lando (and nothing else comes in to do much, suicune is trash and gene coming in and uturning out will do less than 3 ply spikes.) Ideally lando comes in on EP but frania reads it gets a great toxic. Her mew set seems to have the perfect moves for this game. Lando does put out some decent offensive pressure tho. 
6#Great read by frania with the gene switch. If lando EPed, it would have done 45 minimum, and gene won&#x27;t be able to come in again against the hazards. The boom switch was very free for frania so really, great read. However, I&#x27;m not sure if gene even does much after getting in safely. Gene doesn&#x27;t really want to uturn out and have to come in again. Incin switch for the lando slot is super safe. Gene can take out mew and lando will not be able to KO it back.
