0# Opponent’s team seems to be a CM fini balance team with both TR and TW. Metagross could be either shuca or occa berry since oppo has multiple resists to both ground and fire, or possibly some other item like AV/LO. Opponent’s best Pokémon are fini and Zapdos, as Zapdos is good into everything except for P2 and Zygarde, and I only have 1 dedicated cm fini counter in Rillaboom. My best Pokémon by far is P2, as they don’t have a dedicated P2 counter, so I suspect they will have toxic on Metagross for P2. My second best pokemon is zygarde, as it’s great into their two tailwind attackers of heatran &amp; Zapdos. 
So my overall strategy is to try to have Zygarde in when TR is not up, and when TR is up try to chip my oppo’s team into range of CB thousand arrows. My oppo’s strategy is probably to try and set TW or TR and do enough damage to Rillaboom to win with CM Fini.
0*# I lead Zap-g and Zygarde because I’m worried about heatran eruptions in tailwind, and that combo is great into common leads like Rilla, or if oppo decides to set up TR, zap-g is great into P2.

1#turn Oppo’s lead makes me think they’re trying to set up rocks &amp; tailwind. Their options are really to either tailwind or volt switch with the Zapdos, and set up rocks or ice punch with Metagross into the zygarde. I decide to switch Zygarde into P2, as it won’t take much damage from an ice punch, and if opponent sets up tailwind then I can counter with TR. I u-turn with Gapdos to pick up chip and switch into something that can take a potential volt switch.
1*# Once I u-turn, I can either go into metagross, Rillaboom, or Zygarde. If oppo volt switches, then if I go metagross they’ll go into heatran and pick up big damage with eruption. If I go Rillaboom, they could get chip damage on it, and I need Rillaboom to deal with Fini. Or if oppo hurricanes Gapdos slot, then they could do big damage to Rillaboom. So I choose to go Zygarde who can absorb a volt switch and let me switch next turn.
2# Perfect. Now my oppo’s options are to volt switch into P2 and either toxic with the metagross on P2, or ice punch again into Zygarde. I feel like I may just have to live with a toxic onto P2, as setting TR is huge for my team, and P2 can still survive enough turns if toxic’ed. If they ice punch, I can switch into Volcanion who will pressure the opponent’s metagross.
3# Now that opponent’s P2 is on the field, they can thunderbolt my Volcanion or reverse TR, and can do a lot with Metagross like set up rocks/toxic/attack. This Metagross is being a pain and I can’t pressure it with Volcanion to risk getting T bolted, so I decide to just get some chip on it with P2 by attacking with T bolt. I bring in my own Metagross as it can pressure both of these mons well.
3*# Oppo decides to switch in Fini for Metagross, probably because they’re afraid of a heat wave from Volcanion. This tells me they’re definitely not occa berry, and likely not toxic either. I get big chip on the Fini.
4# Opponent’s options here are to protect fini or switch something in to take the thunderbolt, such as rillaboom, and continue attacking or reverse TR with P2. I’m hammer arm on Metagross, which will do around 50%, and make me slower than P2 to ko next turn. So I decide to t bolt and hammer arm the P2 to guarantee a ko on it next turn.
4*# oof annoying miss. At this time I had been getting really bad luck lately and I start thinking if this game is going to continue that streak.
5# P2 options are recover, reverse TR, switch into Fini/Zapdos to take the hammer arm. Oppo Metagross options are to attack or set rocks. I’m not too worried about the Metagross as if I’m able to remove P2 I can win in TR since no toxic on Metagross, so I continue with hammer arming the P2, and thunder bolt that slot to cover for Zapdos/Fini switch ins.
5*# Oppo decides to just keep attacking with P2 and let it take a lot of damage, so it’s heavily damaged at this point and likely can’t switch in on anything.
6# P2 options are to die or switch into something like Tapu Fini or Zapdos. Metagross options are to attack or switch into something that will try to pressure P2 once TR is over. I decide to steel roller the P2, as it can’t miss like hammer arm, it’ll do big damage to Zapdos/Fini, and if my opponent tries to steel roller my P2, it’ll end the terrain first. With P2 I decide to recover to be able to set another TR.
6*# Opponent makes a wild play going into heatran when I’ve been hammer arming that slot.
7# at this point I’m slightly tilting from missing the P2, and my opponent making a huge gamble switching in heatran in the slot I’ve been hammer arming. Oppo’s Heatran slot is basically always going to click eruption here, and Metagross is probably going to either switch or attack. I decide to switch in Zygarde, as it’s on my team to switch into an eruption and take on heatran, and I decide to get enough chip on metagross that Zygarde can ko with thousand arrows, so I t bolt the metagross slot.
7*# Oppo Metagross could ice punch my Metagross slot predicting a zygarde switch in, but I didn’t see this coming. I should have just sacked my Metagross here. However my opponent is running LO heatran with just heat wave, and it gets the 10% burn. At this point I’m pissed over my bad luck, and I really stop thinking about strategy, and am more focused on my bad luck. This is a huge mistake.
8# I should take a minute here to gather myself and re-think of a strategy, but I’m upset and I begin to just click. I’m always clicking thousand waves here, and I think my opponent can either protect with heatran and ko my zygarde with ice punch, or switch out, so I decide to attack the metagross as it will be hard to remove with Zygarde burned.
9# Oppo’s Rillaboom is likely going to fake out my P2, and opponent’s metagross is likely going to attack P2. So I decide to click thousand arrows again as that could KO my opponent’s metagross before it can attack my P2. If opponent fakes out Zygarde, I can recover on my P2 to heal up.
9*# I did not see knock off Rilla coming. I should have since my opponent has no counterplay to P2. And beyond that it crits. At this point I nearly just forfeit I’m so pissed. I’m spending way too much time feeling sorry for myself instead of coming up with a plan, as the game is still winnable.
10# Oppo is definitely going to grassy glide with rillaboom into P2, and I think it’s likely they try to set TW with Zapdos. Since Zygarde is burned, my only real way to damage Zapdos is with P2 ice beam, so I decide that since Zapdos is on the field with P2 I should Ice beam that slot. 
10*# With opponent’s P2 gone, I should have probably just TR with my P2, as my Volcanion &amp; Metagross can do a lot to my opponent’s team in TR. With another crit on my P2, I’m beyond pissed, and all I’m focusing on is my bad luck.
11# Opponent is going to grassy glide the P2 to ko it, and likely moonblast my Zygarde. I should have switched in Rilla for my P2, and gone into Volcanion for my Zygarde. I actually can still use Zygarde vs Heatran, but I decide to just sack it. I’m not thinking anymore unfortunately, just pissed.
12# I should go into Volcanion here and try to make a big read to turn this game around, such as high horsepowering the Fini predicting a heatran switch in, and steam eruption on the Rillaboom for a Zapdos/heatran switch in. however I make a bad choice and go into Gapdos, which my opponent’s Zapdos can just wall. I realize opponent is going to switch in Zapdos, so I u-turn to pivot into something else.
12*# Aaand I got a 30% static chance as well. I’ve mentally given up at this point, and the game is essentially lost, so I won’t annotate beyond this point.

|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|Oppo’s Rillaboom is likely going to fake out my P2, and opponent’s metagross is likely going to attack P2. So I decide to click thousand arrows again as that could KO my opponent’s metagross before it can attack my P2. If opponent fakes out Zygarde, I can recover on my P2 to heal up.

|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|I did not see knock off Rilla coming. I should have since my opponent has no counterplay to P2. And beyond that it crits. At this point I nearly just forfeit I’m so pissed. I’m spending way too much time feeling sorry for myself instead of coming up with a plan, as the game is still winnable.
|turn|10
|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|Oppo is definitely going to grassy glide with rillaboom into P2, and I think it’s likely they try to set TW with Zapdos. Since Zygarde is burned, my only real way to damage Zapdos is with P2 ice beam, so I decide that since Zapdos is on the field with P2 I should Ice beam that slot.

|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|With opponent’s P2 gone, I should have probably just TR with my P2, as my Volcanion & Metagross can do a lot to my opponent’s team in TR. With another crit on my P2, I’m beyond pissed, and all I’m focusing on is my bad luck.
|turn|11
|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|Opponent is going to grassy glide the P2 to ko it, and likely moonblast my Zygarde. I should have switched in Rilla for my P2, and gone into Volcanion for my Zygarde. I actually can still use Zygarde vs Heatran, but I decide to just sack it. I’m not thinking anymore unfortunately, just pissed.

|c| ANNOTATION by Actuarily|I should go into Volcanion here and try to make a big read to turn this game around, such as high horsepowering the Fini predicting a heatran switch in, and steam eruption on the Rillaboom for a Zapdos/heatran switch in. however I make a bad choice and go into Gapdos, which my opponent’s Zapdos can just wall. I realize opponent is going to switch in Zapdos, so I u-turn to pivot into something else.
