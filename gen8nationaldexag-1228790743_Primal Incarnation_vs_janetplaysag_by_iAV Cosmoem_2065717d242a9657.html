0*#The most likely leads from the other side are be zacian or ndm, so janet led jirachi to counter them. at first glance ndm was led probably for stealth rock, playing into janet&#x27;s plan.
1#Surprise heat wave from ndm here, usually the only thing jirachi fears is knock off which it can still tank. heat wave 2hkos, janet is still able to get up trick room. but this has put a wrench in her momentum for now.
2#It turns out ndm is actually slower than jirachi, so it was hit with another heat wave, meaning jirachi was pretty much unable to set trick room for the rest of the game. accordingly she uturned out to yveltal. not sure why she is using yveltal in the first place as she said its subpar on trick room.
3#A sucker here because ndm is definitely slower than yveltal, which primal incarnation tries to capitalize on with zacian. the problem is yveltal will definitely outspeed zacian and do a lot of damage with heat wave, so not the best of plays, but primal incarnation didnt really prep for yveltal that much besides xerneas
4#Zacian actually survives a heat wave, but yveltal also survives behemoth blade because of its hp evs. now primal incarnation is forced to either sack or start pivoting, neither option is a good one. janet has regained the advantage after her jirachi was crippled, so she&#x27;s back in the game.
5#Unfortunate crit oblivion wing from yveltal here, i&#x27;m not really sure why they went ray instead of xern tho. janet doesnt have anything thats comfortable setting tr on ray except a healthy mega audino. the right play here was probably a zacian sack, it does pressure the offensive threats but it&#x27;s obsolete during the whole tr period, plus they could comfortably threaten yveltal with xern.
6#Good sack from janet here to kill rayquaza with life orb recoil. the claydol was probably for stealth rock trick room, and xerneas was brought in maybe expecting yveltal.
7#Xern subs on the trick room. this is actually a dangerous situation because nothing really wants to break the sub. if they do they take a ton of damage. janet is able to safely teleport into her primal kyogre, which likely was the least important figure.
8#Xern dynamaxes here for some reason, getting rid of sub. this is a misplay, as now xerneas has lost 30% more health than it had to, and also plays into janet&#x27;s plan as kyogre was sacked for a sub break anyways. it just went better.
9#Calyrex dynamaxes, taking out xerneas here, in the following turns it will also eliminate ndm and zacian. a much better use of dynamax than primal incarnation&#x27;s.
12#janet takes advantage of hail to score a third kill. trick room is actually over by now, the correct play was calyrex shadow because it could revenge kill and force calyrex ice out. however salamence was brought in instead, which was a misplay for sure.
13#As expected mega salamence is just wiped off the board by calyrex, so primal incarnation just loses a mon.
14#The calyrex-shadow was specs, so mega audino just finished it off with dazzling gleam, and...
20*#...janet claims her victory." data-p1="Primal Incarnation" data-p2="janetplaysag" data-gameformat="gen8nationaldexag" data-credit="iAV Cosmoem" data-gameid="gen8nationaldexag-1228790743">
