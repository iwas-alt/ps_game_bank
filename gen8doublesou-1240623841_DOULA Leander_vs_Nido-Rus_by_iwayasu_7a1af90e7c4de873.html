0#This was a game played between nido-rus and lliama for the crown tundra kickoff tournament quarterfinals.
0*#nido-rus leads fakeout + rocks/uturn/intimidate, a reliable lead that can easily reposition with fakeout uturn and capitalise on a good mu with flipturn + rocks etc. lliama leads Lando + Weezing-g. Not a fan of the lando lead, as it has p bad mus barring heatran. rillaboom&#x27;s fo pressure might allow for easier repos.
1#nido-rus gets up rocks basically for free. Not the end of the world but I think llima could have played more aggresively. Hard switching to boom for unmatched fo pressure next turn, corrosive gas/tspikes. Protecting weezing only makes sense of lando uturns out, but it has an advantages board state anyways so not the most likely. 
2#weezing eats an ep anyways when it could have gotten tspikes up for free and corrosived this turn. Lando could have just hard switched last turn (maybe to kyub and scare lando out). Good thing rillaboom has fo the turn nido-rus&#x27; kyub comes in tho. 
3#heads up play by nido-rus. They probably doubled weezing since rillaboom was always gonna fo. It looked like a free uturn into boom with lando but its better to just ko weezing and not allow it to corrosive/chip kyub/get a free switch and swing the momentum.
4#saccing lando to chip kyub is interesting. Its a massive threat so I don&#x27;t hate it. Maybe there was a chance for phys kyub and intimidate would have helped (havent kept up with the meta enough to know if this is legit tho sry &gt;_&lt;). Straightforward turn for nido-rus. I personally dislike the knock. uturn seemed better there. You get more options and reset fo pressure. 
5#Heres why I prefer uturn. If metagross was in this turn, fiery wrath + mash would have killed kyub anyways and the knock would have been useless. The option of having fo this turn would have been useful. I would prefer uturn to moltres than bring out boom again. 
6#Pretty straightforward turn. No point getting cute for both players.
7#Specs(probably) tran with two turns of tw left. Pretty much over. A more optimal play for nido-rus was to double kyub to blastoise to match fo next turn and have follow me the turn after (I can&#x27;t think of a downside to this but maybe there is one). Small nitpick tho really no reason to get cute with the game already won. 
8#Nevermind didn&#x27;t even think of the lele switch. Thats much sexier lmao. 
9#GG to both competitors. Tough game for lliama. Maybe they could have played more aggressively with switches from behind but honestly ground + ice is incredibly difficult to switch into for their team. Sorry if I seemed to be picking on lliama &gt;_&lt; they&#x27;re definitely a much better player than me and I&#x27;m speaking with the benefit of hindsight." data-p1="DOULA Leander" data-p2="Nido-Rus" data-gameformat="gen8doublesou" data-credit="iwayasu" data-gameid="gen8doublesou-1240623841">
